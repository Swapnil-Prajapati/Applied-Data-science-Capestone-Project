Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we have determine the cost of a launch.   In following scenario where we want to predict whether the SpaceX will reuse their 1st stage and also determine the cost of the launch by the gathered data Several methodologies has been used to achieve this task such as geo spatial analysis and visualizations and finally machine learning.
